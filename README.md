# TCP Client App

In the company where I did my internship, data was collected from different protocols within the scope of the Manufacturing Execution System project. One of the protocols was TCP.
The inequality between driver(server) and printer(client) numbers pushed us to this solution.

I was asked to make changes in the programming language by the engineer who wanted me to work on the project.
The C# language was insufficient to connect to existing OPC Server devices. (For C#, it would also have to install a program for OPC Server and all programs were paid.) So I continued the project with Python language.

You can see the codes I wrote in C# and Python in docs.
